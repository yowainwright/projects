Stickybits is a lightweight alternative to `position: sticky` polyfills that enables elements to remain visible while scrolling, then stop at their parent container boundary.

It prioritizes native CSS support when available and only adds scroll listeners when necessary, making it highly performant for modern browsers while still supporting older ones.
